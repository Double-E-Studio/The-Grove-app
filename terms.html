            <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated: 27 August 2025</strong></p>

            <div class="policy-content">
                <p>These Terms & Conditions apply to the <strong>The Grove - Sleep Sound</strong> app (hereafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, created by Michele Cipriani and Edoardo Bazzotti (hereafter referred to as "Service Provider"). The service is currently <strong>Free</strong>, with the possibility of introducing optional premium features in the future.</p>

                <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these Terms & Conditions. Please read them carefully. Unauthorized copying, modification, or extraction of the source code, trademarks, or any part of the Application is prohibited. All intellectual property rights remain with the Service Provider.</p>

                <h2>Use of the Application</h2>
                <p>The Application is provided "AS IS". The Service Provider strives to ensure the Application is reliable and functional but reserves the right to modify the Application or charge for services at any time. Any charges will be clearly communicated.</p>

                <h2>Personal Data</h2>
                <p>The Application only stores <strong>user preferences and settings locally on the device</strong> (e.g., theme, selected sounds). It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your device.<br>
                The Service Provider advises against jailbreaking or rooting your device, as this can compromise security and affect the Application's functionality.</p>

                <h2>Connectivity and Device Responsibility</h2>
                <p>Some features may require an internet connection. The Service Provider is <strong>not responsible</strong> for issues arising from lack of Wi-Fi, exhausted data plans, or device battery limitations.<br>
                Any charges from your mobile provider (including roaming) are your responsibility. Ensure you have permission if you are not the device's bill payer.</p>

                <h2>Updates and Termination</h2>
                <p>The Application may be updated to maintain compatibility or improve functionality. You agree to accept updates when offered.<br>
                The Service Provider may discontinue the Application at any time without notice. Upon termination, your rights to use the Application end, and you must delete it if instructed.</p>

                <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>While the Service Provider aims to provide accurate and updated information, they rely on third-party sources and accept <strong>no liability</strong> for direct or indirect losses resulting from the use of the Application.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Platforms</h2>
                <p>The Application is provided through third-party distribution platforms such as the Google Play Store and Apple App Store (collectively, "Stores"). Your use of the Application is also governed by the terms, conditions, and policies of the Store from which you downloaded it. You are responsible for complying with any applicable Store rules. The Service Provider is not liable for any actions or obligations of the Stores that may affect your use of the Application.</p>

                <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>These Terms & Conditions may be updated periodically. You are encouraged to review this page regularly. Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>

                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <p>For questions or suggestions regarding these Terms & Conditions, contact the Service Provider at <strong>doublee.studio.team@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
