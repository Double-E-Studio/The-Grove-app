**Last updated: 27 August 2025**

This Privacy Policy applies to the **The Grove - Sleep Sound** app (hereafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, created by Michele Cipriani and Edoardo Bazzotti (hereafter referred to as "Service Provider"). The service is currently **Free**, with the possibility of introducing optional premium features in the future. The Application is provided "AS IS".

## Information Collection
The Application does **not collect any personal information**. Registration or login is not required to use the Application.

## Children
The Application is **not directed to children under 13**.  
No personally identifiable information is knowingly collected from children. Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise their children when using the app.  
If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact the Service Provider at **doublee.studio.team@gmail.com**.

## Security
The Application does not transmit or store personal information externally, so there is **no risk of unauthorized access** to user data. Local preferences are stored securely on the device.
